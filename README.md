# Exploration: Deploy Word Embeddings

Motivated by a code challenge, this projects serves as a playground to explore word embeddings and their deployment.
The main objective is to train word embeddings from a corpus of tweets, which come labeled with respect to their sentiment.

The goal is to run a dockerized web server that can be used to query word embeddings.
